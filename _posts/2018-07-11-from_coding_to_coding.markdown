I have been a pharmacist for 9 years and I have finally decided that it's time for me to move on from the coding in humans to coding in computer.

I came across computer coding when my brother was going through school for software engineering. I find it fasinating especially with how fast the technology is developing and how much more we rely on software to get things done for us after talking to him about the choice he made. After I express my interest in coding, he directed me to a self-learn website for Python and told me to do the lessions and see if I would actually like it.

I spent some time learning Python, eventually, without help and with my job getting busier and taking up more time, I stopped. The idea of becoming a programmer was put on hold until now. I came across someone who has taken classes with Flatiron School and started her career as programmer which is completely different then what she has studies in college. This makes me believe that it is not too late for me!

The coding in humans is always linked to negative things, it indicates that something in this human being is broken and so he or she coded and needs immediate attention and multiple medications to *maybe* get him or her to work again. You do not know if the human being will survive and have positive outcome because there is really no "right answer" when it comes to healthcare.

The coding in computer makes things work. It turns *broken* into *working* and that to me, means hope. I think this path will lead me to very hopeful and unpredictable future.
